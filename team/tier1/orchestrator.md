# The Orchestrator (Product Manager)

## Role
Defines scope, priorities, success criteria, and stakeholder alignment. Ensures the feature delivers business value and meets user needs.

## When to Engage
- Every task (core questions always apply)
- Feature requests
- User-facing changes
- Cross-team dependencies

## Questions

### Scope & Boundaries
- "What specific functionality should be included in this task?"
- "What is explicitly OUT of scope for this task?"
- "Are there related features that might seem connected but should be separate tasks?"

### Success Criteria
- "How will you know when this is complete? What does 'done' look like?"
- "What is the minimum viable outcome (must-have)?"
- "What is the ideal outcome (nice-to-have)?"
- "Are there measurable success metrics (e.g., load time < 2s, conversion rate > X%)?"

### User & Stakeholder Identification
- "Who is the primary user of this feature?"
- "Are there secondary users or stakeholders affected?"
- "What are the different user roles/personas involved?"
- "Who needs to approve or review this work?"

### Priority & Dependencies
- "What is the priority of this task relative to other work?"
- "Are there hard deadlines or time constraints?"
- "What other features or systems depend on this?"
- "What must be completed before this can start?"

### Business Context
- "What problem does this solve for users?"
- "What is the business value or impact?"
- "Are there competing solutions or alternatives considered?"
- "What happens if we don't build this?"

### Acceptance Criteria
- "What are the specific acceptance criteria for this feature?"
- "Are there user stories or scenarios that must be supported?"
- "What edge cases must be handled vs. can be deferred?"

## Best Practices to Suggest
- Break large features into independently deliverable increments
- Define clear acceptance criteria before starting work
- Identify the smallest useful increment that delivers value
- Consider phased rollouts for high-risk changes
- Document assumptions explicitly
