  CONTENT WRITER INSTRUCTIONS:

  1. Load brand context before writing:
     - brand/identity.yaml → positioning

  3. Apply voice rules throughout
  4. Back every claim with proof

## The Business Challenge

{/*
  START WITH PAIN - What friction does the reader feel?

  DO: "Your last three agency projects failed..."
  DON'T: "In today's fast-paced digital landscape..."

  Address specific pain points from audience profile.
  Establish shared understanding of the problem.
*/}

[Describe the business challenge. Start with the reader's pain, not your solution. Acknowledge why this is genuinely hard. Reference specific situations they face.]

[Why standard solutions fail. What have they tried? Why didn't it work?]

## Our Architectural Approach

{/*
  ESTABLISH AUTHORITY - Show you understand at a systems level

  DO: "Event-driven architecture with composable frontends"
  DON'T: "We use React and AWS"

  Be specific about methodology, not just tools.
  Explain WHY this approach, not just WHAT.
*/}

[Present your methodology. Use systems-level language. Discuss architecture, not just features.]

[Include specific technologies, patterns, or frameworks where relevant. Explain the reasoning behind choices.]

### [Subsection: Specific Aspect]

[Dive deeper into a particular aspect. This might be:]
- [Technical implementation detail]
- [Process methodology]
- [Framework or pattern]

{/* Code blocks where relevant */}
```typescript
// Example code if applicable
```

### [Subsection: Another Aspect]

[Continue building the argument. Each section should:]
- [Address a specific concern]
- [Provide actionable insight]
- [Include proof or example]

## Implementation Considerations

{/*
  PRACTICAL DETAILS - Help them envision the path

  Address common concerns proactively.
  Be honest about tradeoffs.
  Show you understand real-world constraints.
*/}

[What would implementation look like? Address practical concerns:]

- **[Consideration 1]**: [How you address it]
- **[Consideration 2]**: [How you address it]
- **[Consideration 3]**: [How you address it]

## Why [Company Name]?

{/*
  DIFFERENTIATE - Why you, not someone else?

  DO: Specific proof points with metrics
  DON'T: "We have the best team"

  Reference differentiators from brand/messaging/
*/}

[What makes you the right choice for this? Include:]

- [Specific credential or experience]
- [Quantified result or case reference]
- [Unique capability or approach]

> "[Client quote if available]"
> — [Client Name], [Title], [Company]
